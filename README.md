### Twedit is a clone of the Twitter android app - but with editable tweets.
Twedit was built using Android Studio and written in Kotlin.
This clone works with its own backend (An ExpressJS REST API), which you can find at [Twedit-API](https://github.com/DeanEncoded/Twedit-API).

I recorded the entire session of making this app.

## Building Twedit yourself :hammer:
If you wish to build Twedit from the source code, simply clone the repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/DeanEncoded/Twedit.git
```
Then open the the cloned directory with Android Studio and you'll be good to go.
